# Email-Spam-Detection-Using-CNN
This project focuses on detecting whether the email is spam or legit using a web app created using streamlit . Before that, we check which machine learning model perform the best using various performance metrics. 

Project title: An NLP Based Email Spam Detection 

Requirements

IDE/tools: Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit
Browser: Chrome/Firefox
Python libraries to install : numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, streamlit

Dataset : email.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balaka18/email-spam-classification-dataset-csv/data)

Setup Instructions

Step 1: Install Anaconda Navigator (https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator)

Step 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook

Step 3: Open the source code folder and run all the cells of emaill.ipynb, emaillearn.ipynb and CNN.pdf sequentially 

Step 4: Generate cnn_model.keras and tokenizer.pickle

Step 5: Launch Pycharm 

Step 6: Make sure cnn_model.keras and tokenizer.pickle are in same folder as app.py

Step 7: In the terminal, run: streamlit run app.py

Step 8: Enter text and press check button to see the result.
